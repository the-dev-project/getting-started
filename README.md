# Getting Started

Hello everyone! Welcome to TheDevProject community. We are glad to have you here with us and we hope that together, we can have a great summer!

Before we dive into the good stuff here is a guide to help you get started with setting up your development environment. You will need to set up quite a few things so please read this guide very carefully.

If you face any issues do not hesitate to reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/thedevproject/shared_invite/zt-188do2238-kzLTiP0~7TjRip~~bJIt9Q)!

## <a name="vscode"></a> Setting up VS Code

Visual Studio Code or VS Code for short is a text editor made by Microsoft. We are going to use VS Code throughout our journey because it is a very popular text editor and it comes with very nice features.

VS Code is available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. You can go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download and install it on your operating system.

One of the many things that makes VS Code powerful is its extension's library. There are tons and tons of extensions created by other developers that we can add to VS Code to help us in our development process. Below you can find resources on how you can install extensions in VS Code and a few recommendations from us that we believe will be very beneficial to you.

[How to install extensions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)

## <a name="git"></a> Setting up Git

**Note: If you are on MacOS, you might already have Apple git installed.**

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, used for collaborating. You can go to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) to download git for your operating system.

To check if you have successfully installed git you can open:

- `git bash` on Windows
- `terminal` on Mac or Linux

Then you can type in

```
git --version
```

If you have set up everything correctly this should show you the git version that is installed on your computer.

## <a name="github"></a> Setting up GitHub

GitHub is a website that consists of millions of git repositories created by other developers. You will upload your project to GitHub so you can access it whenever and showcase it to others. To get started with GitHub you will need to [create an account](https://github.com/).

Now comes the first challenging task of this program. You need to set up an SSH key so your computer can _"talk"_ to github securely. You can read more [about SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) on GitHub docs. Setting up SSH consists of multiple steps:

1. [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. [Add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) (Follow Web Browser steps)
3. [Test your SSH connection](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

The linked guide in each step has instructions for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

We recommend you to spend some time figuring this out yourself if you get stuck as this will expose you to one very big and indispensible skill in Software Development, _Googling_. While you work as a software engineer, you will inevitably get stuck on a problem to which you don't know the solution to. In this program, you have TheDevProject's experienced team to help you out but, we want you to be able to adapt and grow your skill as a self learner and what better way to learn than to do? ðŸ˜‰

However, if you can't seem to progress after some amount of time do reach out to us as this all might be relatively new to you and you will eventually get to the point where you won't even need our help!
